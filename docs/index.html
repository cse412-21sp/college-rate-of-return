For example, during COVID period especially quarantine would causes people-relying industries (restaurants, shopping center) several losses, but as time goes they would develop their own ways to deal with the problems (such as deliveries). And the limitations COVID brought to people are somehow “beneficial” to the development of several industries, companies like Netflix and Amazon who mostly rely on online services would experience more customer usage than ever; and Bio-Medical companies like Moderna is also getting paid by people’s hope of producing the vaccines.</p><p>In the following context we will provide visualizations for aspects of the markets and give the audience a sense of how to choose a industry of interest and target several companies.</p><h2 id="part-1:-market-health-overview">Part <!-- -->1<!-- -->: Market Health Overview</h2></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><img src="./static/images/map.png" alt="example"/></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><p>
       As introduced in the beginning, <em>Warren Buffet</em> held a concept of what was called - <strong><em>Value Investing</em></strong>.
     </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
       But what defines “Value”? What standard makes a company or its stock price “wonderful” or “fair”?
     </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
       And this is what we will step into in this project. To begin with, let’s take a look at the market as a whole.

Lower ratio indicates a undervalue stock price; 2. Higher ratio indicates a overestimated stock price.</p><p>And for the <strong>Price<!-- -->/Sales</strong> ratio, calculate as a company’s market cap divided by its total sales or revenue over the past year, we tend to invest those companies with lower ratio. If the P/S ratio is lower than comparable companies in the same industry that is profitable, investors might consider buying the stock due to the low valuation.</p><h3 id="dividend-to-eps">Dividend to EPS</h3><p>Prior to understand the visualization of this part, we first need to learn the meanings of the variable.
(<span class="checkbox-reminder">Check the box once finish reading!</span>)</p><p><input type="checkbox" class="idyll-checkbox"/><strong>Dividend Yields</strong> <span class="idyll-display">is a company&#x27;s total annual dividend payments divided by its price per share, assuming the number of shares is constant. It is often expressed as a percentage. Dividend yield is used to calculate the earning on investment (shares) considering only the returns in the form of total dividends declared by the company during the year.</span></p><p><input type="checkbox" class="idyll-checkbox"/><strong>Earnings<!-- -->/Shares</strong> <span class="idyll-display">Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as a company&#x27;s profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. The resulting number serves as an indicator of a company&#x27;s profitability.</span></p><div style="display:none"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/financials-book/Sheet1?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="120%" height="600"></iframe><p>Both variables serve as important estimators of the companies profitability, and in most cases:</p><p>1. With fixed/similar Dividend Yield, company with higher EPS means more potential in growth of the stock price.</p><p>2. With fixed/similar EPS, company with higher Dividend Yields results in more stable income (Although not much!).</p></div><h2 id="part-3:-company’s-seasonal-reports">Part <!-- -->3<!-- -->: Company’s seasonal reports</h2><p>One of the documents to read prior to buying stocks will be the seasonal reports of the target company, where the balance sheet, income statement and their plans will be listed, we could then use them to estimate the profitability of the company.</p><p>We picked 5 technology companies (Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, NVIDIA) to make a dataset, and compare their indexes within 1 year period! The reason we picked technology companies is that during COVID period, their operation are not likely to be negatively affected but possibly affected positively which follows our expectation to the stock market (economy) without the COVID - should be increasing overtime.</p><p>In this section we will focus more on the background of the data instead of the numbers themselves. It is always important to think through the reasons behind the observations when investing, is the increment in profit by chance or causes by any events? Should we invest if anything similar happens again?</p><h2 id="income-overview">Income Overview</h2><p>First of all let’s take a look at the Revenue of each company during 2020 March to 2021 March.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/financials-book/Sheet6?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><p>We observed that every company has an increasing trend during the year of 2020 which met our expectation, no matter rapidly or slowly. The difference in slopes are determined by various variables which cannot be reflected simply by reading its revenue. So lets take out the cost of producing the merchandizes and taxes and look at the net income of each companies again.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/financials-book/Sheet7?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><p>Where now we can see that the spike of Amazon during 2020 season 3 is no more obvious, however the<span class="appleSpike"><span class="annotated-text">spike for apple<span class="annotation-text">Compares to other companies during the same period that actually took no inspiring move, we actually expect apple to have this increment since they released their new iPhone, and it&#x27;s always the same season each year, so some investors would buy the stock before the period and sell it once the price reaches their expectation.

still exist.</p><h3 id="operating-expenses-and-operating-income">Operating Expenses and Operating income</h3><p>During each season we can use the comparison between operational expenses and income to interpret any specific events happened to the company, or entire industry and market.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/financials-book/Sheet8?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><p>Most companies have way more operating expenses than their operating income, so we will compare their trendline across seasons to understand more about the ratio. As we can see from the visualization that Netflix is the only company with a negative slope across the 5 seasons period, which its operational income is gradually increasing with the expenses decreasing.</p><p>Which is explainable - comparing Netflix to other companies, it relies more on their merchandizes/selling their products instead of the operating things; where companies like Apple and Amazon, whos income are partly consist of their cloud service.</p><h3 id="gross-profit-each-season-and-same-season-different-year-comparison">Gross Profit each season and same season different year comparison</h3><p>Another important index when evaluating is the Gross Profit, which is the pre-tax revenue minus the cost of the production. Since the tax policy is different pre and post Biden, we will use the index to see the difference of income of the opening season for year 2020 and 2021.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/financials-book/Sheet9?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><h2 id="part-4:-conclusion">Part <!-- -->4<!-- -->: Conclusion</h2><p>Paragraph here to conclude our thoughts to the question, quotes are preferred to add at last.</p><p>Cite sources at the very last!</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/27/apple-profits-latest-quarter-surge-pandemic">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/27/apple-profits-latest-quarter-surge-pandemic</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paytonfisher/sp-500-companies-with-financial-information">https://www.kaggle.com/paytonfisher/sp-500-companies-with-financial-information</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/">https://www.macrotrends.net/</a></span></p><p>And quotes sources!</p></div></div></div></div>
